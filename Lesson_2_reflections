What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Logical change Tracked by status, where as in directory I can still be working a logical change on the file 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Workflow making a commit
working directory -> staging area ->repository

git init  	# initialises a new repository with git

git add 	# adds a file from the working directory to the staging area 
git reset 	# removes a file from the staging area to the directory

git log   	# lists all files in a repository
git status 	# shows which files have changed since last commit

git diff 	# compares differences between two commits. 'git diff ID commit1 ID commit2'

git checkout ID		# takes you to commit ID
git checkout master # takes you to master commit branch

git clone
